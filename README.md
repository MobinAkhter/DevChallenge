# DevChallenge

### Had trouble connecting web api with react. This was the first time I had react as frontend with .NET Core web api backend. Usally, I did HTML, CSS, JS. 

### That took a lot of my time today, but I was not able to figure out some of the errors popping up, while coding simulatenously. 

### Though it would be better to work on the front and backend seperately, to showcase my dev skills. Later, once I understand how to connect front and backend, I can merge the two branches.

## Optimistic I could learn how to solve it by Sunday.

## From my understanding, to publish the web application:
### dotnet publish -c Release -o published  | This would package the entire app for production
### All the necessary files will reside in the build folder of the React app section. For example, if you're using "dotnet new react" template, everything would be ready ### to deploy inside the ClientApp build folder. 

### After this, you can add this build folder to a hosting service such as Netlify, Heroku etc.
